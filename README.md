Data Set- Heart disease 
The dataset used in this assignment is the heart disease dataset available in heart-c.csv from the Blackboard. This dataset describes 13 risk factors for heart disease. The attribute num represents the (binary) class attribute: class <50 means no disease; class >50_1 indicates increased level of heart disease.

Data Dictionary:
age  = age in years 
sex  = sex (1 = male; 0 = female) 
cp  = cp: chest pain type  
Value 1: typical angina  
Value 2: atypical angina  
Value 3: non-anginal pain  
Value 4: asymptomatic 
trestbps = resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
chol   = serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
fbs   = (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
restecg   = resting electrocardiographic results : 
Value 0: normal  
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST 
elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)  
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by 
Estes' criteria 
thalach   = maximum heart rate achieved 
exang   = exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
oldpeak  = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
slope   = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment : 
Value 1: upsloping  
Value 2: flat  
Value 3: downsloping 
ca   = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
thal   = 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 
num   = diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) : 
Value 0: < 50% no disease  
Value 1: > 50% increased level of heart disease 

With a liitle bit of modification in the dataset, both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms has been used to predict the Heart Diseases based features.
